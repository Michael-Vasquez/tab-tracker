This is a beginner tab saver I learned in Scrimba and enjoy how versatile and helpful it is.

To install:

- save the files from the workspace folder to a personal folder
- open Google.com
- select the options with the three ellipse
- select the chrome extensions and then manage extensions
- select load unpacked
- select the personal folder with files
- the tab tracker should be listed

To use:
- select the extensions and select the tab tracker
- it will bring up a box with three selections
- save input
- save tab
- delete all

- you can manually put in a url such as www.google.com and hit save input and it will save
- you can also hit save tab to save the current tab you are viewing
- to delete all, double click the delete all to delete all saved tabs
